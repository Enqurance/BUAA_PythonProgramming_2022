# Eng Py Programming

## 1.Introduction to Python

**Static language and dynamic language:**

​		In static language, the most important trait is that, you must declare the data type before compile the program, or there will be exceptions. However, in dynamic language you don't have to declare that bofore.

**Interpreted language and compiled language:**

​		Program which is coded in compiled language compile only once, and there is an intermediate process if complitation and linking.Interpreted language is executed while interupting.

## 2.Environment Configuration

### **A.Two modes to run code**

**Interactive mode:**

​		You can get feedback immediately, but you can't save anything.This mode is only suitable for simple programming.

**Script mode:**

​		Just like normal programming, you code on a text editor and then run the code.This type is the most used.

### B.Reversed words

​		Some words are occupied in Python, which means there not for private use.Please pay attenetion to them.

### **C.Basic program structure**

**Identifier:**

​		Identifier is the name used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules and other objects. It is a combination of character digits and underscore.Rules are as follow:

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Except for the first character, it contain any combination of letters, numbers and so on.
- ......

​		When you name a identifier, please pay attention to the name rules. Resonable identifier names can make your program more understandable. There are two main type of naming style, and they both based on the logical breakpoint of your identifier:

- Underscore style: Each logical breakpoint in the name is marked with and under score and similiar or same name should be avoided.
- camelScore: Just like the style's is named, each logical break point in the name is marked with a capital letter.

**D.Simple Statement**

​		Statements which are very simple.You only need one line to code them. Such as **Input**, **Output**, **Assignment** and so on.
